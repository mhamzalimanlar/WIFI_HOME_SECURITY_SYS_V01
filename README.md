# WIFI_HOME_SECURITY_SYS_V01
 
The system is designed with a 220V AC input and a 12-5V DC output. A DB105STR bridge diode, an STM41T00M6F RTC module for clock information, and a MicroUSB type-B interface are used. The system also features a MAX6662 temperature sensor for indoor temperature control, a TFPT PTC thermistor for outdoor temperature control, and a LHI-878 PIR sensor for motion control in the outdoor environment. The PIR sensor is controlled by a NCS36000 controller. There are two 12V relays for lighting control and an ESP32 WiFi module for wireless communication. Communication between the main microcontroller (STM32f103) and these components is established through the USART, SPI and I2C protocols. The design includes two PCBs: one for the main board and one for the auxiliary sensor board. The boards have 2 layers for signals and 2 layers for power and ground planes, for a total of 4 layers. The design was created using the Altium DesignerÂ program.
